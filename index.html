          collecting data on citizens.
        </strong>

        <p>
          More alarmingly, private companies have become more efficient than
          administrations at gathering information. Traditional governmental
          methods - telephone surveys, forms and in-person interviews - continue
          to be the benchmark in accuracy, yet their inherent inefficiencies are
          becoming more apparent. In a typical OECD country, over 3,000
          employees work in the National Statistics Department, undertaking the
          heavy lifting of government data collection.
        </p>

        <p>
          Costly and inefficient cycles that span years from inception to
          completion stand in stark contrast to the real-time analytics deployed
          by tech giants. Their platforms are capable of monitoring millions of
          users daily, highlighting the growing need for faster and leaner
          techniques to complement traditional data collection approaches.
        </p>

        <strong>
          The company behind Facebook and Instagram, Meta, has collected data on
          77% of all internet users with about 3.9 billion people active on at
          least one of its platforms (as of Q3 2023 Statista).

          The issue is not limited to collection methodologies. National
          statistics departments struggle to provide the granular, timely data
          required for modern policymaking. In emerging countries, the data
          itself is often incomplete: the informal economy, which accounts for
          15% of the OECD's GDP, remains largely uncharted by conventional
          methods, highlighting a gap in government data.

        At the same time, policymaking is increasingly granular (See
        Whiteshield's Citizen Navigator). As governments create dynamic policies
        that are tailored to individual citizens, the need for timely and
        detailed insights becomes critical. To navigate this new terrain,
        governments must evolve by adopting big data and AI-driven analytics.
      </p>

      <p class="w-100">
        Whiteshield's AI Economics Unit is at the forefront of integrating
        advanced AI capabilities into practical applications. Our latest
        research showcases the remarkable potential of new AI tools to support
        data collection for regional economic assessment.

      <h4>Transforming Satellite Imagery into Economic Insights</h4>
      <p>
        In assessing a region's economic health, the conventional barometer has
        been its Gross Regional Product (GRP), similar to GDP on a more
        localised scale. This measure is central to policymakers' ability to
        formulate nuanced, region-specific strategies. But in many emerging
        countries, where robust data is still often scarce, Whiteshield has
        turned to innovative approaches, notably the use of satellite imagery,
        to measure regional economic performance.
      </p>

      <p>
        To achieve this, the process involves breaking down satellite images
        into smaller, manageable pieces. These pieces are then analysed by
        artificial intelligence algorithms. Specifically, the current
        state-of-the-art is a type of machine learning known as Convolutional
        Neural Networks (CNNs). These networks require humans to first prepare
        extensive sets of example images, each one meticulously categorized by
        hand, to teach the system how to recognize various features. This
        process is both resource-intensive and technically challenging,
        particularly in developing countries with unique landscapes, such as
        those in the Middle East.
      </p>

      <h4>The Power of Language Models in Regional Analysis</h4>
      <p>
        Whiteshield is leading the way with an innovative solution in this
        field. The AI Economic Analysis Tool uses Large Language AI Models, such
        as OpenAI's GPT-4, to analyse satellite images. This approach is gaining
        recognition for its potential versatility across different fields of
        socio-economic research, in contrast with current expert systems which
        are tailored for specific tasks.

            In a study examining 72 detailed satellite images of Dubai, the two
            different methods were compared for accuracy. The first method, a
            Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), was trained using images that
            had been pre-labelled by humans.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            After several days of training, this method made errors amounting to
            7.32% on average. In contrast, a newer approach using the AI
            Satellite Economic Analysis Tool and GPT-4, which did not rely on
            any pre-labelled images and took only minutes to run, achieved an
            error rate of 11.9%.

        While slightly less accurate overall, Whiteshield's approach showed
        superior performance at identifying buildings and roads, which are key
        elements in assessing economic health.

                In the example shown, Whiteshield was asked to quickly respond
                to an agriculture intensity assessment task, which would have
                required the development of a model especially trained for
                desertic crops with the traditional method . With the AI
                Economic Analysis Tool, the dataset was loaded and a scoring
                formula was defined with relevant stakeholders, allowing to
                deliver a precise sectoral estimate for an area of 4000 km2 in
                48h.

                Continued research suggests an optimistic future where AI,
                especially LLMs like GPT-4, will transform the way policies are
                developed. Alternative sources will supplement, and perhaps
                replace the current survey-based approach.

                Whiteshield is providing a concrete example of the tools to
                come: the AI Economics Unit is currently developing new
                capabilities for the AI Economic Analysis Tool - such as cell
                tower activation, night light intensity, real estate prices,
                etc. - to provide policymakers with near real-time analysis
                specific to their sector and at an unprecedented level of
                detail.

                  Continued research suggests an optimistic future where AI,
                  especially LLMs like GPT-4, will transform the way policies
                  are developed. Alternative sources will supplement, and
                  perhaps replace the current survey-based approach.

                  Whiteshield is providing a concrete example of the tools to
                  come: the AI Economics Unit is currently developing new
                  capabilities for the AI Economic Analysis Tool - such as cell
                  tower activation, night light intensity, real estate prices,
                  etc. - to provide policymakers with near real-time analysis
                  specific to their sector and at an unprecedented level of
                  detail.
